# data-scrapers

This is the repository for data scrapers used by the Red Mountain Makers to gather data regarding:

* Regional middle and high school tech education (in development)
* Regional children's tech and programming summer camps (not yet developed)
* Regional children's tech and programming focused afterschool programs (not yet developed)
* Automated gathering of space supply prices (not yet developed)

We are creating these scrapers because a lot of local and regional information available online is not well structured and easy to gather. This information is needed to support regional tech education advocacy -- and for the last item, to make shopping for space supplies smarter, easier and more cost-efficient.

Other scraper ideas:
* Craigslist, eBay and auction scrapers to monitor equipment for sale
